# BLOCS: Blocking Location and Obstruction Cataloguing System
An open-source and user-friendly Python algorithm for detecting and tracking atmospheric blockings and subtropical ridge obstruction events.
This is a working copy in python 3.9 of the methodology presented in [Sousa et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0658.1). Some alterations are available as a namelist_input.txt file.

# What do I need to get and run BLOCS?

## To run BLOCS, you need

   * [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3-3776AB.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)
   * [![Git: ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git--blue)](https://git-scm.com/)

and

 * [![Anaconda 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anaconda-3-green.svg)](https://www.anaconda.com/) (or similar to manage python packages)

or

  *  [![python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3-3776AB.svg?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org) and the required modules on a cluster

## The packages required to run BLOCS are:
  
```
- numpy
- xarray
- scipy
- os
- pickle
- pandas
```

# Installation

1 - Clone BLOCS repository.

 ```
git clone https://github.com/mikaslima/BLOCS.git
  ```

2 - Verify you have installed all packages requiered for BLOCS. If you use an Anaconda environment, please be sure you have activated the environment.

# Running the algorithm

## Input data

The code takes any resolution, regularly spaced data (tested with 2.5ยบ, 1ยบ, and 0.25ยบ). Ideally, the name should be "Z500_(start year)_(end year)_(hemisphere)_(name of institution)" for example: "Z500_1940_2023_NH_ECMWF.nc". The variable names inside the file should be "z" for the geopotential at 500 hPa in units of [m], "time" as datetime format [YYYY-MM-DD], "lat", and "lon" for the coordinates in degrees.

## Code

The algorithm itself is divided in 3 major steps/scripts: Daily structure identification, structure tracking in time, and production of the catalogues with general statistic (by daily observation, event) and the respective observation masks.
In each of these, the preamble contains a set of variables to be changed by the user in the "Data/Input_data/namelist_input.txt" file (see description below).
These codes may have significant departures from the MATLAB application of [Sousa et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0658.1), the ones I considered are marked as such in the code.
To run successfully the code please edit the namelist according to your needs and run the scripts in succession.

# Namelist description

Name           | Description
-------|----------------|--------------------------------------
use_subset          | (1) Uses the full set of data from the input file; (2) Use a subset of data from the input data file (this enables the "year_i" and "year_f" inputs)
year_i              | (any number, int) year within the file to start the analysis, not used if "use_subset" is "1"
year_f              | (any number, int) year within the file to end the analysis, not used if "use_subset" is "1"
year_file_i         | (any number, int) first year of the data file
year_file_i         | (any number, int) last year of the data file
res                 | (any number, float) resolution of the data (e.g. 2.5, 1, 0.25)
region              | (NH) Northern Hemisphere or (SH) Southern Hemisphere
data_type           | (any string) name of institution of the data, in the name of the file
min_struct_area     | (any number, int) threshold total area for the structures (usually 500000)
n_days_before       | (any number, int) number of days before the analysis day to compute the LATmin (usually 15)
horizontal_LATmin   | (1) Uses a horizontal LATmin as in Sousa et al. (2021); (2) Uses a variable LATmin with longitude
omega_hybrid_method | (1) Uses the same condition to identify hybrid blocks as in Sousa et al. (2021); (2) Uses a new condition, which considers the Rex area within the structure.
consider_polar      | (1) Considers polar area the same way as in Sousa et al. (2021); (2) Computes the gradient northward of the (90-delta) boundary and extends the structure conditions over this boundary, but cut the area poleward of 85ยบ for continuity problems; (3) Completely ignores the area poleward of (90-delta)
lat_polar_circle    | (any number, float or int, ideally between ~60 up to 90) Latitude of the polar circle to consider a Rex block to be of a polar nature (usually is set to 75)
delta               | (any number, float or int) Delta in degrees to compute the gradients (usually set to 15 degrees)
tracking_method     | (1) Use a "OR" condition, either the overlapping area is exceeding the "area_threshold" in the day of the analysis or the previous; (2) Use a "AND" condition, the overlapping area must exceed the "area_threshold" in both of the day of the analysis and the previous.
area_threshold      | (float, between 0 and 1) Fraction of overlap needed to consider the evolution of the structure (usually set at 0.5)
persistence         | (any number, int) Minimum number of days for an atmospheric blocking to be considered an event
